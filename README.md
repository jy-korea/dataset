# dataset
These files are for simulating a conseusns control of a multi-agents sytem

A file with a name starting with "one" has 9 attributes :
e x v neighbor_x neighbor_v neighbor_a u_pre s u

A file with a name starting with "two" has 12 attributes : 
e x v neighbor1_x neighbor1_v neighbor1_a neighbor2_x neighbor2_v neighbor2_a u_pre s u

e : the position error of the current node

x : the position of the current node

v : the velocity of the current node

neighbor_x : the position of the neighbor node

neighbor_v : the velocity of the neighbor node

neighbor_a : the acceleration of the neighbor node

u_pre : the partial control signal generated by subracting the sliding part from the sliding mode control

s : the sliding variable of the sliding mode control

u : the sliding mode control
